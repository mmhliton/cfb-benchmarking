## Performance Benchmarks

### 1GB File Creation Performance

| Implementation | Real Time | CPU Time (User) | System Time | Peak Memory | CPU Usage |
|----------------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| **cfbcpp (Memory)** | 13.74s | 12.87s | 0.86s | 1.03GB | 99% |
| **Rust Native** | 19.66s | 19.40s | 2.47s | 35MB | 99% |
| **CompoundFile** | 0.01s* | 0.00s | 0.00s | 3.8MB | 75% |

*CompoundFile shows demo time only - actual implementation would require file adapter

**Analysis:**
- **cfbcpp** achieves fastest creation through memory-based operations but uses ~30x more memory
- **Rust Native** provides balanced performance with minimal memory footprint and actual file persistence
- **CompoundFile** demonstrates API structure but requires additional implementation for file I/O

### Stream Traversal Performance

| Implementation | Real Time | CPU Time (User) | System Time | Peak Memory | CPU Usage |
|----------------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| **cfbcpp** | 0.01s | 0.00s | 0.00s | 4.7MB | 53% |
| **CompoundFile** | 0.00s | 0.00s | 0.00s | 4.4MB | 83% |
| **Rust Native** | N/A* | N/A* | N/A* | N/A* | N/A* |

*Rust traversal was part of the longer benchmark cycle

**Analysis:**
- Both C++ implementations show near-instantaneous traversal of structured compound files
- Memory usage remains minimal (~4-5MB) for traversal operations
- cfbcpp handles larger datasets (40 entries, 27 streams) efficiently

### Stream Modification Performance

| Implementation | Real Time | CPU Time (User) | System Time | Peak Memory | CPU Usage |
|----------------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| **cfbcpp** | 0.00s | 0.00s | 0.00s | 4.7MB | 42% |
| **CompoundFile** | 0.00s | 0.00s | 0.00s | 4.2MB | 83% |
| **Rust Native** | 0.38s | 0.11s | 0.15s | 35.5MB | 72% |

**Analysis:**
- **cfbcpp** and **CompoundFile** show optimized performance for small-scale modifications
- **Rust Native** demonstrates more comprehensive modification operations with integrity verification
- Memory usage patterns reflect the architectural differences (memory-based vs. file-based operations)

## Build System Analysis

### Build Time and Complexity

| Implementation | Build System | Build Time | Complexity | Dependencies |
|----------------|-------------|------------|------------|--------------|
| **Rust Native** | Cargo | 0.23s | Low | Native Rust ecosystem |
| **cfbcpp** | CMake + FFI | ~2-3s | Medium | Rust + C++ toolchains |
| **CompoundFile** | CMake | ~2-3s | High | Complex header translations |

**Analysis:**
- **Rust** provides the fastest build times with native dependency management
- **cfbcpp** requires dual toolchain setup but achieves good integration
- **CompoundFile** involves complex header translation making it the most complex to build
